You walk upon the Temple of Arikene...
The planet itself is a desert with a cream colored sky, with bands of orange and peach. It has no moons, and one high density planetary ring made up of ice and gas.
It is 1.32x the size of Earth, and is 0.35 AU from its star "Ujothan-387B".
The temperature ranges from -94F to 243F with an average of 80F. It is unsuitable for earth-based lifeforms without additional assistance from water reclaim suits with protection from extreme temperatures.
It is 8% water, all subterranean...
The length of day is 18 Hours, and the length of year is 100 Earth days.
The planet is inhabited by a race of Humans native to the planet called The Alkahn.
The Alkahn are a calculating race, that have a social hierarchy that of wolves. Alien species to the planet call them "Al\'it-hakri" which translates to "those who fight like demons".
The Alkahn have a temple of their God "Ith\'ui Kahn". This temple is frequently subjected to raids from aliens who seek a prize hidden within that only the most creative minded souls could conjure an idea of what it could be.
The Alkahn have laid traps and a beast within to guard their temple and it\'s prize...
You are a fixer that lives on a technologically advanced planet, here to gain a quick buck with this rumored prize. You took the long journey across the universe, and are now only left with a broken pistol, and a sharp titanium knife. You must rely on with and your surroundings if you wish to live.
You enter the temple... You walk down a set of steps and are immediately graced by a damp darkness, with the only bit of light from the entrance showing the walls of what appears to be a hallway, but it is still much too dark to see ahead of you.
You can - however, make out the faintness of a hall just off to the left...
What will you do?
